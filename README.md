### IOTA Streams health data prototype
This rust application demonstrates the use of the IOTA Streams rust library to send private health data over the IOTA Tangle. 
The prototype was developed as part of a Master's Thesis examining the use the IOTA Tangle for health data management.

This application is built using a template repo for [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/eframe), a framework for writing apps using [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui/).
